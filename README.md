# Harvesting-Tools
The best free Harvester Hoe plugin.

Harvester Hoes are mainly used in the factions gamemode to allow farming of sugar cane (economy) made easy. Essentially when a player is holding a harvester hoe and hits a block of sugar cane, the sugar cane will not drop and go directly into that players inventory.
